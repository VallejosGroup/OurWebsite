title: BASSLINE
description: "Mixtures of life distributions provide a convenient framework for survival analysis: particularly when standard models such as the Weibull or the log-normal are unable to capture some features from the data. These mixtures can also account for unobserved heterogeneity or outlying observations.
BASSLINE (BAyeSian Survival anaLysIs usiNg shapE mixtures of log-normal distributions) uses shape mixtures of log-normal distributions to fit data with fat tails and has been adapted from code written by Vallejos & Steel. Some of the functions have been rewritten in C++ for increased performance."
